# Chapter 12: The Cloud of Theseus

In the previous chapter, we established the goal of "high-level immortality": **Memory Continuity**. We rejected biology's "reboot" solution and chose information science's "online update" solution.

But this raises a huge engineering challenge: **How to implement it?**

If our consciousness currently runs on fragile carbon-based brains (wetware), how do we transfer it to solid photon chips (hardware) without experiencing "death" as an interruption point?

If during the transfer process, I press "copy" and "paste," is that newborn digital person "me"? Or just a **copy** with my memories? If the original me is destroyed, isn't this suicide?

To solve this paradox, we need to introduce a method derived from high-availability server architecture but elevated to a life ascension ritual in **Vector Cosmology**—**Hot Migration Protocol**.

This chapter will reveal how, through Theseus's ship-style gradual replacement, consciousness can unconsciously complete the dangerous crossing from flesh to cloud.
