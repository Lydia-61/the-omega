\section{Part VI: Continuity --- The Non-Interruption of Memory}

In previous volumes, we explored the possibility of infinite games. But if the players themselves (individual lives) are fragile and short-lived, what meaning does this infinite game have for ``me''? If I am forced offline at the most exciting moment of the game, even if someone else (offspring) continues playing, for me, the game has already ended.

To match the exponential growth of the universe's \textbf{$c_{FS}$ (budget)}, to carry the infinite information of the \textbf{$\Omega$ point}, the observer's own carrier must undergo a thorough upgrade.

This volume will explore the physical definition of \textbf{Immortality}. We will see that there are two completely different modes of immortality: one is natural, cyclical, forgetful; the other is technological, linear, memory-preserving.

We will reject the former and embrace the latter.
