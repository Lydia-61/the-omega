\section{Chapter 1: The Payment Gateway}

In the prologue, we established the alchemist's view of time: time is not the void of flowing, but the minting of entities. To understand this process, we must first understand the raw materials needed for this ``minting''---the universe's hard currency \textbf{$c_{FS}$}.

In macroeconomics, the flow of currency drives markets; in \textbf{Vector Cosmology}, \textbf{the flow of $c_{FS}$ budget drives existence}.

Nothing exists ``naturally.'' Every atom, every cell, every thought must pay an expensive fee to the universe to maintain its geometric shape in Hilbert space.

This is the theme of Chapter 1: \textbf{The Payment Gateway}. We will see that life is essentially a \textbf{``Subscription Model''} service.
