\section{Part V: Rejection --- The Infinite Game}

We have minted golden bodies, established the identity of the only player, and even sublimated loneliness. In traditional narratives, this should be the ending. The hero overcomes challenges, obtains treasure, and lives happily ever after.

But \textbf{Vector Cosmology} rejects this ending.

If ending means ``completion,'' means ``no more change,'' then ending is \textbf{death}.

In a self-generating universe driven by $e$, in a spiral universe pulled by $\phi$, \textbf{``fulfillment''} is the greatest enemy.

This volume will overturn all assumptions about ``endpoints.'' We will prove that the universe is not a finite game designed to ``clear levels,'' but an \textbf{infinite game} designed to \textbf{``keep the game going forever''}.
