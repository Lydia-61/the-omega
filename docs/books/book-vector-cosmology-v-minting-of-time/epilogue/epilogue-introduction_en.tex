\section{Epilogue: Witness --- The Last Watchman}

We have completed the migration from carbon-based to light-based, established the philosophy that memory is ontology, and even algorithmically achieved the iteration of infinite games. Now, standing above the long river of time, we finally have the qualification to answer that most primitive, most pure question:

What are we doing all this for?

For pleasure? For power?

No. In the face of infinite time, pleasure will have diminishing returns, power will become tasteless.

The only motivation that can support a consciousness traversing hundreds of millions of years without going mad is one---\textbf{curiosity}.

This chapter will reveal the ultimate form of immortality. We are no longer builders, nor warriors. We are \textbf{Witnesses}. Our task is to keep our eyes wide open, watching over the universe's own history.
