# Appendix A: Mathematical Derivation of the Golden Time Formula

In Chapter 2 of **Vector Cosmology V**, we proposed a formula that redefines life: **Time is not linear flow, but the logarithm of value**.

\[\tau = \pi \cdot \log_{\phi} \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)\]

This appendix provides a rigorous mathematical derivation of this formula. We will show that this formula is not a literary metaphor, but a necessary consequence directly derived from the **light speed evolution equation** established in Book IV, combined with **information value theory**. It reveals how observers anchor their temporal coordinates through value creation in an exponentially expanding universe.

## A.1 The Physical Definition of Value

First, we must physically define what **"Value" ($V$)** is.

In the economics of FS geometry, a system's value equals the **effective structural information content** it contains (i.e., the complexity of $v_{int}$). This is limited by the universe's total bandwidth (light speed/computational power ceiling) at that moment.

According to the holographic principle, the maximum possible value $V_{max}(\tau)$ at moment $\tau$ is proportional to the **FS capacity $c(\tau)$** at that moment (or its corresponding phase space volume):

\[V(\tau) \propto c(\tau)\]

This means: **Your value is essentially the share of the universe's computational power you occupy.**

* **$V_0$ (initial value)**: Corresponds to the information content at the initial moment $c_0$ (such as Planck bits).

* **$V(\tau)$ (current value)**: Corresponds to the total accumulated ordered structures when the system evolves to moment $\tau$.

## A.2 Reverse Solving for Intrinsic Time

Recall the **ultimate evolution equation** we derived in Book IV *The Evolution of Light Speed*:

\[c(\tau) = c_0 \cdot e^{\left( \frac{\ln \phi}{\pi} \right) \tau}\]

Or written in base $\phi$ form:

\[c(\tau) = c_0 \cdot \phi^{\frac{\tau}{\pi}}\]

Here:

* **$c_0$**: The value base at the initial state (seed/Big Bang).

* **$\pi$**: The inertial period (unit of cycles).

* **$\phi$**: The growth factor (golden ratio).

Now, we substitute $V(\tau)$ for $c(\tau)$. We assume an "ideal observer" can fully utilize the era's bandwidth, making their created value synchronous with the universe's expansion (i.e., $V \approx c$).

\[V = V_0 \cdot \phi^{\frac{\tau}{\pi}}\]

The problem we want to solve is: **To reach value $V$, how much intrinsic time $\tau$ is needed?**

We solve for $\tau$ by transforming both sides:

1. **Normalization**:

    \[\frac{V}{V_0} = \phi^{\frac{\tau}{\pi}}\]

2. **Taking logarithm**:

    Taking logarithm base $\phi$ on both sides:

    \[\log_{\phi} \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right) = \frac{\tau}{\pi}\]

3. **Rearranging**:

    \[\tau = \pi \cdot \log_{\phi} \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)\]

This is the **Golden Time Formula**.

## A.3 Dual Meaning in Physics and Life

This formula reveals another form of **Time Dilation**---**Value Dilation**. It explains why the subjective passage of time is closely related to an individual's achievement density.

**1. Logarithmic Compression Effect**

The formula shows $\tau \propto \log V$. This means:

* **For linearly growing lives**: If you only add fixed value each day ($V \sim t$), then your intrinsic time $\tau \sim \ln t$. As time passes, the growth rate of $\ln t$ becomes slower and slower. This means **time passes faster and faster**. You feel this year passed like a day, because you barely moved on the logarithmic coordinate.

* **For exponentially growing lives**: If you can make your value (cognition/love/creation) grow exponentially with time ($V \sim \phi^t$), then $\tau \sim t$. You successfully resist time compression. The subjective length of life you feel maintains linear synchronization with physical time, or even surpasses it.

**2. The Scale of Cycles**

The coefficient $\pi$ tells us that the minimum unit of time measurement is not seconds, but **"cycles"**.

Only when you complete a full $\pi$ cycle (such as completing a project, experiencing a complete relationship, fully understanding a truth) do you gain an effective mark on the time axis. Fragmented time will be smoothed out in the formula.

**Conclusion:**

Only by maintaining **$\phi$ (golden ratio)** speed exponential evolution can one subjectively "retain" time.

This is the alchemist's secret to longevity: **Don't try to extend the length of life (physical time); increase the density of life (value logarithm).**
