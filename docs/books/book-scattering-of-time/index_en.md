# The Scattering of Time

**Subtitle: Geometric Reconstruction: From Bits to the Universe**

This is a journey about re-examining the ontology of the universe. Since we are writing in the style of *A Brief History of Time*, we will touch upon those deep structures hidden beneath the appearance of reality not only through equations, but also through metaphors and intuition.

### Part II: The Great Dispersion

In Part I, we established the universe's ontology: a state vector evolving at constant rate $c$ in Hilbert Space. But this is only the background of the story. In the foreground, in our sensory world, this unified rate is scattered. It splits into what we see as "spatial displacement" and "temporal flow."

This splitting is the origin of all motion and change in physics.

### Part III: The Knots of Time

In this part, we will no longer view time as a continuously flowing river, but as a digital sequence composed of countless tiny beats. We will discover that so-called material particles—electrons, quarks, photons—are not independent entities floating in void, but special **topological structures** on the underlying computational grid. They are "dead knots" in the flow of time.
