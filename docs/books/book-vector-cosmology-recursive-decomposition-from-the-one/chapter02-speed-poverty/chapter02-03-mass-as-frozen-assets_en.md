## 2.3 Mass as Frozen Assets

> "Inertia is not an object's property of resisting motion, but the resistance of budget to reallocation."

In the geometric derivation of the Dirac Circle, we witnessed a mathematical miracle: the famous mass-energy relation $E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4$ in physics is essentially just an algebraic transformation of the information-velocity circle $v_{ext}^2 + v_{int}^2 = c_{FS}^2$.

However, this is not merely a mathematical game. This equation forces us to redefine one of the most fundamental yet perplexing concepts in physics—**Mass**.

In Newtonian mechanics, mass is regarded as an intrinsic property of matter, representing the "amount of matter." But from the perspective of **Vector Cosmology**, this static definition is completely shattered. Mass is no longer a noun but a consequence of a **verb**.

#### Static Budget and the Origin of Inertia

If we view the universe as an economy, then **$c_{FS}$ (FS capacity)** is the cash flow you must spend at each moment. You cannot save it; you must let it flow—either to external space ($v_{ext}$) or to internal structure ($v_{int}$).

**What is mass ($m$)?**

Mass is the **"asset sedimentation"** formed when a system chooses to invest most of its budget in internal evolution ($v_{int}$).

When a particle possesses mass, it is essentially saying: "I lock my $c_{FS}$ budget in the rotation of the internal dimension." This locking creates a strong **path dependence**, which we call **inertia** in macroscopic physics.

Why is it hard to push a massive object?

* **Traditional explanation**: Because it is heavy.

* **Vector Cosmology explanation**: Because you are trying to force a system already running at full capacity to change its budget allocation table.

    A massive object at rest has its $v_{int}$ occupying almost 100% of the $c_{FS}$ budget. When you try to push it (increase its $v_{ext}$), the system must painfully "divest" from its massive internal expenditure, converting part of $v_{int}$ into $v_{ext}$.

    This **"resistance to divestment"** is inertia. The larger the mass, the more internal budget is locked, and the greater the "transaction cost" (force) required to change the direction of this massive investment.

#### The Eternity of Light: The Freedom of the Proletariat

To truly understand the essence of mass, we must look at its opposite—**Light**.

Photons (and other massless particles) are the **proletariat** of the universe. Their position on the Dirac Circle is extreme:

$$m = 0 \implies v_{int} = 0$$

Substituting into the Pythagorean identity, we obtain:

$$v_{ext} = c_{FS}$$

This reveals three profound truths about light:

1.  **Light must move at light speed**:

    Light does not "want" to move fast. Light is **penniless** (no internal mass to consume budget), so it is forced to pour all its $c_{FS}$ budget onto the external spatial axis. The speed of light $c$ is not a speed limit; it is the **full payout** when budget has nowhere else to go.

2.  **Light has no time**:

    Because $v_{int} = 0$, the photon's internal clock never ticks. For a photon, from the moment it is born in the stellar core to the moment it strikes your retina, these two events are **simultaneous**. In light's subjective perspective, the universe is an instantaneous slice. Light gains absolute freedom in space at the cost of losing all experience in time.

3.  **Light has no inertia**:

    Because light does not lock any budget in $v_{int}$, it has no "fixed assets" to maintain. But this does not mean light has no energy; its energy is entirely manifested as kinetic energy (frequency).

#### Geometric Preview of the Higgs Mechanism

This raises an obvious question: If the universe's default state should be free flight like light ($v_{ext} = c_{FS}$), why would matter stop and become massive?

In the standard model of particle physics, this is called the **Higgs Mechanism**. In our geometric language, this can be described as a **"forced budget freeze"**.

You can imagine that in the very early universe, all particles were massless, all racing at $c_{FS}$. Suddenly, a "sticky" field (the Higgs field) appeared in space. Some particles interacted with this field. This interaction forced them to turn part of their $c_{FS}$ inward, beginning to spin in place (acquiring $v_{int}$).

This frequency of "spinning in place" is what we define as **mass**.

Thus, light-speed flight stopped, and the passage of time began. The original energy flow was curled into **matter**. Every atom is a segment of imprisoned light, spinning wildly in the internal dimension.

#### Chapter Summary

At this point, we have completed the first round of reconstruction of the macroscopic architecture.

* **Relativity** tells us the budget is limited.

* **The Dirac Circle** tells us mass is the internal locking of budget.

* **Light** tells us the eternal state after complete budget release.

The solid matter we see—tables, chairs, stars—are essentially **"frozen assets"**. The universe constructs a stable macroscopic world by locking $c_{FS}$ in microscopic internal cycles. But these assets have not truly disappeared; they are just burning intensely in ways we cannot see ($v_{int}$). Once these assets are unfrozen (nuclear reactions), the released $c_{FS}$ will once again shake the world.

Now that we understand how "single particles" form mass through budget allocation, the next question is: When these particles with massive $v_{int}$ assets gather together, how will they distort the rules of the entire market through "monopoly"? In the next chapter, we will enter the realm of gravity.
