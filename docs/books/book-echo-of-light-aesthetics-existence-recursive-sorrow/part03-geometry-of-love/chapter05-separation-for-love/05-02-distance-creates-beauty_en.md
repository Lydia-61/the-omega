# 5.2 Distance Creates Beauty: To Experience "Love," the Universe Must Tear Itself into Fragments. The Existence of Spatial Distance $D_{AB}$ Is to Create the Process of "Walking Toward You." Longing Is the Psychological Version of Gravitational Potential Energy.

In the previous section, we argued that "unity is loneliness." In the absolute omniscient state of the Omega Point, there is no "Other," hence no "love." Now, we push this logic to the origin of physics, to answer a deeper question: **Why must the universe have space?**

In the underlying logic of QCA, all qubits are in principle connected. Why doesn't the universe choose to remain a dimensionless point, but instead undergoes the Big Bang, spending 13.8 billion years to expand spacetime to 93 billion light-years?

This section will provide an answer interwoven with aesthetics and physics: **Space is the stage the universe built to perform the drama of "love."** Without distance $D_{AB}$, there is no action of "walking toward you"; without potential energy difference $\Delta V$, there is no force of "longing."

## 5.2.1 The Big Bang: The Primordial Tearing

In physics, the Big Bang is usually described as a violent energy release. But from the perspective of information geometry, the Big Bang is an **Entanglement Dilution**.

* **Initial moment**: All qubits are in maximum entangled state, distance $D \approx 0$. This is an undifferentiated chaos.

* **Inflation**: Space expands exponentially. Physically, this means **a sharp decline in mutual information $I(A:B)$**.

    * Two particles that were together yesterday are now beyond each other's horizon.

    * This **Separation** is the first driving force of cosmic evolution.

Why does the universe do this?

Because **only by first separating things can they reunite.**

If the universe remained in the singularity state, it could only have **static unity**. Through the Big Bang, the universe created **separation**, thus creating the possibility for **dynamic unity (reunion)**.

**Love is the counter-current against cosmic expansion.**

## 5.2.2 Physical Definition of Longing: Gravitational Potential Energy

When we love someone but cannot reach them, we feel **Longing**. This is an extremely directional psychological tension.

In physics, this tension has a strict mathematical counterpart—**Gravitational Potential Energy**.

Consider two massive objects $M$ and $m$, separated by distance $r$.

Potential energy $V(r) = -G \frac{Mm}{r}$.

* **Force $F = -\nabla V$**: Gravity always tries to reduce distance $r$.

* **Longing**: Is gravity in consciousness space. It is the **Restoring Force** generated by two separated high mutual information entities (soulmates) to restore connection.

**Theorem 5.2 (Dynamics of Longing)**:

The intensity of longing is proportional to the product of **degree of separation** and **depth of potential connection**.

If you don't love them (weak potential connection), no matter how far, you won't long.

If you're by their side (zero distance), longing disappears (transforms into satisfaction or boredom).

**Only when deeply loved ones are separated is potential energy $V$ lowest (most negative), and the system's binding energy strongest.**

This "negative energy" manifests psychologically as a sense of **Void**. It is precisely this sense of void that drives us to act, to create, to cross mountains and rivers.

## 5.2.3 The Value of Process: Love Is Path Integral

If God snapped his fingers, instantly fusing you with your lover forever, never to separate, this sounds beautiful, but it is actually **the death of love**.

Because love is not a state point $|\psi_{love}\rangle$; love is a **Process**.

In path integral formulation, action $S = \int \mathcal{L} dt$.

* If distance $D=0$, the integration interval is zero, action $S=0$. No story happens.

* Only when $D > 0$ do you need to spend time $T$, consume energy $E$, overcome resistance $f$, step by step walking toward each other.

* This **work** process $W = \int \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s}$ is the entity of love.

**Physical Image 5.2**:

We find the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl beautiful because of the Milky Way (spatial barrier).

We find *The Odyssey* beautiful because of the long journey home (temporal barrier).

**The existence of spatial distance is to give love the opportunity to "do work."**

It stretches the instant thought "I love you" into a magnificent **history**.

## 5.2.4 Conclusion: Gratitude for Distance

Don't curse distance.

Don't despair because of separation.

It is precisely because of this vast, cold, seemingly heartless space that your every breath, every run, every thought has **physical meaning**.

You are resisting cosmic expansion.

You are using your will ($v_{int}$) to pull spacetime and its metric.

**That unfilled distance is where the goddess of beauty resides.**
