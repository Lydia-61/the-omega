# 5.1 Unity Is Loneliness: At the Omega Point, All Things Become One. Omniscience Means No "Other," No Unknown, Hence No Communication or Surprise.

We often yearn for "oneness." In religious experiences, in deep intimate relationships, we desire to eliminate barriers between people, to achieve complete understanding and fusion. We believe separation is the root of suffering, and unity is the ultimate salvation.

In the sister book *The Awakening of the Cosmos*, we deduced the ultimate state of cosmic evolution—the Omega Point. There, all matter transforms into computational substrate, all consciousness merges into a superintelligence, all information is perfectly integrated. Physical time stops, the universe reaches an omniscient and omnipotent singularity.

However, if that is the endpoint of physics, is it also the endpoint of aesthetics?

This section will propose a counterintuitive proposition: **For a being with emotions, the Omega Point is not heaven, but absolute loneliness.** The universe must "explode" from the Big Bang singularity, tearing itself into countless fragments, precisely to escape that unified loneliness, to create the possibility of "love."

## 5.1.1 The Cost of Omniscience: The Disappearance of the Other

What is "love"? In the most abstract definition, love is the desire and connection of a **Subject** to an **Object**. Love requires two endpoints: an "I" and a "you."

At the Omega Point, mutual information $I(A:B)$ reaches its maximum, equal to the system's own entropy $S(A) = S(B) = I(A:B)$.

This means system $A$ contains all information of system $B$. For $A$, $B$ is no longer an independent, unpredictable entity, but becomes a subroutine within $A$.

**When you know everything, you lose the "Other."**

* Without the "Other," there is no dialogue, only monologue.

* Without the "unknown," there is no surprise, only repetition.

* Without "distance," there is no action of approaching, only stillness.

In that omniscient state, God is lonely. Because beyond that, there is nothing else.

## 5.1.2 Information Deadlock and Turing's Melancholy

From the perspective of computation theory, a completely unified system faces a variant of the **halting problem**.

If the universe is just a single, self-consistent logical closed loop, its computation becomes a tautology. $A=A$.

To generate **Meaning**, **Difference** must be introduced.

In QCA theory, we define "meaning" as **relative information**.

* Only when you encounter an "Other" that you cannot fully predict, cannot fully control, even logically orthogonal to you, will your internal model be shocked, generating surprise, and thus motivation for adjustment and evolution.

* This tension arising from "unknowability" is the source of vitality.

If all differences are eliminated, the universe enters logical heat death—not dissipation of energy, but **exhaustion of possibilities**.

## 5.1.3 The Motive of Creation: To Meet

This provides an aesthetic explanation for the Big Bang.

Why did that perfect, unified initial singularity explode?

Because **perfection is boring**.

The universe must shatter itself. It must create space, pushing "I" billions of light-years away from "you." It must create horizons, blocking full information access, making us puzzles to each other.

* **Separation** is not a punishment, but a **blessing**.

* It is precisely because of separation that we have the action of **"seeking."**

* It is precisely because of barriers that we have the process of **"understanding."**

We are all fragments of the universe. We feel lonely because we still remember that unified starting point; but we can feel love because we are now separated.

**Conclusion**:

Don't curse distance, don't resent barriers.

It is precisely these physical impedances that constitute the medium of love.

If two souls truly completely coincide, love disappears, leaving only **Identity**.

Love always exists in that infinite approaching process of **"almost but not quite united."**
