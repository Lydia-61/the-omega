# 1.2 Topological Rigidity of Memory: Why Is Changing a Person's Values Harder Than Moving a Mountain? Because Values Are Topological Knots with High $M_I$. To Maintain "Who I Am," We Refuse to Become "A Better Me."

In the previous section, we explained the tendency to "maintain the status quo" using physical inertia. Now, we extend this concept from simple kinematics to complex **cognitive dynamics**.

We often say: "It's easier to move mountains than to change one's nature." Why is it so difficult to change a person's deep beliefs (values)? Is it merely stubbornness?

In QCA consciousness physics, there is a deeper geometric explanation: **Values are topological knots in the consciousness manifold with extremely high information mass ($M_I$) and non-trivial winding numbers ($\mathcal{W}$).**

## 1.2.1 Geometric Definition of Values: High-Dimensional Dead Knots

In this theory, a person's **worldview** is not a loose collection of facts, but a **self-consistent logical closed loop**.

* **Loose beliefs** (such as "nice weather today"): Like microwaves (photons) rippling on the surface of the consciousness manifold. They are easy to generate and easy to dissipate. Changing them requires minimal energy.

* **Core values** (such as "honesty is good," "I am an atheist"): Like a **vortex** or **dead knot** (electron/proton) deeply embedded within the manifold.

    * It is self-referential: It maintains its own stability through circular reasoning (because I believe A, B is right; because B is right, A is right).

    * It is topologically protected: You cannot eliminate it through continuous perturbations. To change it, you must first **break** this cycle (undergo phase transition/collapse), then reweave.

## 1.2.2 The Cost of Change: Topological Energy Barrier

If we want to change a person's core values (for example, turning a conservative into a radical), what is this physically equivalent to?

This is equivalent to **attempting to untie a topological knot**.

In QCA, untying a knot with winding number $\mathcal{W}=1$ requires crossing a huge **Energy Barrier**.

1.  **Input energy**: You need to input massive amounts of information (arguments, emotional shocks), raising the system's free energy $F$, pushing the state toward an unstable critical point.

2.  **Phase transition (collapse)**: At the critical point, the original logical closed loop breaks. This is subjectively experienced as extreme **Cognitive Dissonance**, pain, confusion, even self-doubt.

3.  **Reorganization**: The system relaxes under new parameters, forming a new knot with a different winding number.

**Why is it harder than moving a mountain?**

A mountain's inertia is merely the sum of its atomic masses (linear superposition).

A value's inertia is an exponential function of its **logical depth**. A value system that has operated for decades, highly self-consistent, may have an $M_I$ greater than the physical information content of a mountain.

Therefore, the "persuasive force" required to change it is astronomically large in terms of information entropy.

## 1.2.3 Defense Mechanism of Identity: To Maintain "Who I Am"

Why do we resist change so strongly? Why would we rather hold onto a wrong belief than accept a painful truth?

This is not merely psychological defense; it is a **steady-state maintenance mechanism of physical systems**.

In Book 3, we defined the "self" as a topological knot.

If this knot is untied, then mathematically, **"I" disappears**.

* **Root of fear**: Fear of value change is essentially fear of **self-death**.

* **Rejection of optimization**: Even if becoming "a better me" (a state with lower free energy) is beneficial in the long run, in the short term, it requires first destroying "the current me."

    * To maintain "who I am" ($I_{identity}$), we instinctively refuse to become "a better me" ($I_{optimized}$).

**Conclusion**:

Physically, we are not merely slaves to inertia; we are inertia's **guardians**.

Our stubbornness is a tragic effort to maintain a tiny bit of "invariance" in this flowing universe.

Every time we refuse to change, we are declaring to the universe: **"Even if the world changes, I will maintain my shape."**

This topological rigidity is the source of human dignity and the root of human tragedy.
