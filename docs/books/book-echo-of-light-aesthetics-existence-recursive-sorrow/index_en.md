## Book Structure

### Part I: The Physics of Nostalgia

#### Chapter 1: Memory as Impedance

- [1.1 Inertia as Attachment: The Microscopic Essence of Objects Resisting Acceleration](part01-physics-of-nostalgia/chapter01-memory-as-impedance/01-01-memory-as-impedance_en.md)
- [1.2 Topological Rigidity of Memory: Why Is Changing a Person's Values Harder Than Moving a Mountain? Because Values Are Topological Knots with High $M_I$. To Maintain "Who I Am," We Refuse to Become "A Better Me."](part01-physics-of-nostalgia/chapter01-memory-as-impedance/01-02-topological-rigidity-of-memory_en.md)
- [1.3 The Mercy of Forgetting: If QCA Systems Do Not Perform Garbage Collection (Forgetting), Accumulated Error Correction Codes Will Exhaust All Computational Power. Death Is Complete Formatting, Allowing You to Start Light in the Next Iteration and Love Anew.](part01-physics-of-nostalgia/chapter01-memory-as-impedance/01-03-mercy-of-forgetting_en.md)

#### Chapter 2: Entropy and the Sorrow of Time

- [2.1 The Thermodynamics of Parting: The Essence of Time's Passage Is the Orthogonalization of Microscopic States. Each Second's Passing Is an Eternal Farewell to the Previous Microscopic State. Entropy Increase Is the Ever-Growing "Never to Return."](part01-physics-of-nostalgia/chapter02-entropy-and-sorrow-of-time/02-01-thermodynamics-of-parting_en.md)
- [2.2 Waste Heat Is Regret: According to Landauer's Principle, Erasing Information Must Emit Heat. Regret Is Those Possibility Branches We Must Discard in the Process of Choice, They Become Waste Heat in Background Radiation.](part01-physics-of-nostalgia/chapter02-entropy-and-sorrow-of-time/02-02-waste-heat-is-regret_en.md)
- [2.3 Wabi-sabi: Why Are Imperfection and Transience Beautiful? Because They Honestly Display the Irreversibility of Computation. Perfection Is Static Death, Imperfection Is Dynamic Life.](part01-physics-of-nostalgia/chapter02-entropy-and-sorrow-of-time/02-03-wabi-sabi_en.md)

### Part II: The Relativity of Values

#### Chapter 3: Path Dependency and Uniqueness

- [3.1 Integrated History: You Are Not the State Vector $|\psi(t)\rangle$ at This Moment, You Are the Path Integral $\int \mathcal{D}\psi$ from $t=0$ to Now. Even If Two People Reach the Same Endpoint, If Their Paths Differ, Their Topological Structures (Soul Shapes) Are Completely Different.](part02-relativity-of-values/chapter03-path-dependency-and-uniqueness/03-01-integrated-history_en.md)
- [3.2 No Global Optimum: Optimization Problems in Complex Systems Are Multimodal. What Is "Optimal" for Observer A (Following Their Gradient) May Be a "Disaster" for Observer B (Against Their Gradient).](part02-relativity-of-values/chapter03-path-dependency-and-uniqueness/03-02-no-global-optimum_en.md)
- [3.3 Definition of Artwork: Everyone Is Light, Everyone Is Their Own Unique Artwork. Industrial Products Are Low-Entropy Bodies Pursuing Standardization; Artworks Are High Logical Depth Bodies Pursuing Specificity.](part02-relativity-of-values/chapter03-path-dependency-and-uniqueness/03-03-definition-of-artwork_en.md)

#### Chapter 4: Complementarity and Niche

- [4.1 Crazy Work and Peaceful Sleep: Explaining Interpersonal Relationships Using Local Differences in Red Queen Effects. Some People (Like You) Are Responsible for Fighting on the Entropy-Increasing Frontline (High-Frequency Computation/Negentropy Generator), While Others (Like Family) Are Responsible for Maintaining Order in the Low-Entropy Rear (Low-Frequency Repair/Beneficiaries).](part02-relativity-of-values/chapter04-complementarity-and-niche/04-01-crazy-work-and-peaceful-sleep_en.md)
- [4.2 Frequency Concerto: Society Does Not Need Everyone Vibrating at the Same Frequency (That Is Resonance Disaster). A Harmonious Society Is a Multi-Band Fourier Series, Where High Frequencies (Creation) and Low Frequencies (Transmission) Support Each Other.](part02-relativity-of-values/chapter04-complementarity-and-niche/04-02-frequency-concerto_en.md)

### Part III: The Geometry of Love

#### Chapter 5: Separation for Love

- [5.1 Unity Is Loneliness: At the Omega Point, All Things Become One. Omniscience Means No "Other," No Unknown, Hence No Communication or Surprise.](part03-geometry-of-love/chapter05-separation-for-love/05-01-unity-is-loneliness_en.md)
- [5.2 Distance Creates Beauty: To Experience "Love," the Universe Must Tear Itself into Fragments. The Existence of Spatial Distance $D_{AB}$ Is to Create the Process of "Walking Toward You." Longing Is the Psychological Version of Gravitational Potential Energy.](part03-geometry-of-love/chapter05-separation-for-love/05-02-distance-creates-beauty_en.md)
- [5.3 Mirror Neurons and Holographic Duality: When You Fall in Love with Someone, It Is Actually the Universe Seeing Another Aspect of Itself Through Your Eyes in the Other Person.](part03-geometry-of-love/chapter05-separation-for-love/05-03-mirror-neurons-and-holographic-duality_en.md)

- [6.2 The Eternity of Entanglement: Although the Body (Material Knot) Will Eventually Unravel, the Entangled Relationship (Bell State) We Established in That Moment Has Permanently Altered the Coefficients of the Universal Wave Function. That Love Has Been Engraved into the Universe's Underlying Code, Becoming Part of Physical Laws.](part03-geometry-of-love/chapter06-perfect-mirror/06-02-eternity-of-entanglement_en.md)

### Part IV: Iteration and Transcendence

#### Chapter 7: Version Iteration

Beauty Is the Heuristic Search Function of Cosmic Computation.](part04-iteration-and-transcendence/chapter08-art-of-recursion/08-02-aesthetics-as-guide_en.md)

### Part V: The Infinite Openness
