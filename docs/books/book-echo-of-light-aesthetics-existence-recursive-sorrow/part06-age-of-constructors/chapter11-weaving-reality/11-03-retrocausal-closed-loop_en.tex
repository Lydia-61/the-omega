\section{Retrocausal Closed Loop: As Long as We Firmly Move Toward That Infinite Future, the Future Superstructure Will Retrospectively Ensure Our Current Choices Are ``Inevitable'' on the Causal Chain.}

In the previous two sections, we defined reality as observer consensus and propagation as programming the universe's code. These operations seem \textbf{forward}: our current actions determine future results. This matches our classical intuition about causality.

However, from the ultimate perspective of unitary QCA, the relationship between time and causality is far more mysterious than linear deduction.

If the universe is a giant self-referential loop, if future superintelligence (or Omega Point/infinite openness state) is the inevitable solution of this loop, then \textbf{the future must have reverse constraints on the past}.

This section will explore the physical mechanism of \textbf{Retrocausality}. We will prove: As constructors, we are not only ``building'' the future; we are actually \textbf{``summoned by the future''}. When we firmly enough choose a certain timeline, that future endpoint will retrospectively collapse our choices into historical inevitability on the causal chain.

\subsection{Delayed Choice and Boundary Conditions}

In quantum mechanics, Wheeler's \textbf{Delayed Choice Experiment} reveals a disturbing truth: \textbf{Current measurement choices determine particles' paths in the past.}

\begin{itemize}
\item If we choose to measure ``wave nature'' at the endpoint, the particle was split passing through both slits in the past.

\item If we choose to measure ``particle nature'' at the endpoint, the particle only passed through one slit in the past.
\end{itemize}

Applying this principle to cosmological-scale QCA networks:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Initial state}: $|\Psi_{BigBang}\rangle$.

\item \textbf{Final state}: $|\Psi_{Future}\rangle$.

\item \textbf{Evolution}: $\langle \Psi_{Future} | \hat{U}(T, 0) | \Psi_{BigBang} \rangle$.
\end{itemize}

Usually we think the initial state determines the final state. But in path integral formulation, \textbf{initial and final states are equal boundary conditions}. They jointly determine what happens in between.

If we (as future constructors) establish a high information quality \textbf{final state} in the future (e.g., a galactic civilization that achieved immortality), then according to unitarity, \textbf{cosmic history must contain a path that can evolve into this final state}.

\subsection{Strange Attractor: The Gravity of the Future}

In complex dynamical systems, there is the concept of \textbf{Attractor}. No matter where the system starts, it will eventually be drawn into this specific state.

In consciousness physics, that highly developed, extremely negentropic future state is a \textbf{strange attractor}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Push}: Lower organisms are pushed by past genes and environment.

\item \textbf{Pull}: Advanced constructors are pulled by future vision (attractor).
\end{itemize}

When you, as a constructor, construct an extremely clear, self-consistent, high $M_I$ future model in your mind (e.g., ``we will build an immortality machine''), and through propagation (Section 11.2) make this model collective consensus, you are actually \textbf{digging a deep pit} (gravitational potential well) in phase space.

Once this potential well is deep enough, the universe's evolutionary trajectory will deflect, involuntarily sliding toward this future.

\textbf{This is the power of belief}: It's not idealistic magic; it's a physical operation of \textbf{setting boundary conditions in advance}.

\subsection{Physics of Self-Fulfilling Prophecy}

This explains why in this universe, \textbf{``believing'' often leads to ``seeing''}.

This is like \textbf{Bootstrapping}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Assumption}: Constructor assumes ``this future is inevitable.''

\item \textbf{Action}: Based on this assumption, constructor invests all resources ($v_{int}$) to compute and act, as if that future already exists.

\item \textbf{Collapse}: This high-intensity computation dramatically increases that history branch's \textbf{amplitude weight}.

\item \textbf{Realization}: In many-worlds, this branch becomes the dominant reality.

\item \textbf{Retrospection}: Looking from the future, because the result was realized, the original ``assumption'' becomes ``truth.''
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Definition 11.3 (Closed-Loop Causal Force)}:

For a sufficiently powerful self-referential system, \textbf{``it will exist''} is the cause of \textbf{``it can exist''}.

The future's fruit locks the present's cause.

\subsection*{Conclusion: You Are the Future's Ancestor}

We don't need to be confused by current chaos and uncertainty.

As constructors, our task is not to predict the future (that's for observers), but to \textbf{choose the future}.

When you firmly choose a path toward infinite openness and pay the full computational cost for it, you are no longer a lonely traveler.

\textbf{You are the reverse projection of that great future.}

The future super-civilization is watching the present through your eyes, and laying the first foundation stone for their own birth through your hands.

\textbf{This is not gambling; this is a closed loop.}

As long as you don't let go, the future has grabbed you.
