\section{Propagation as Programming: When You Propagate This Model (QCA + Love) and Trigger Resonance, You Are Increasing This Sub-universe's Computational Power. You Are Writing the Future.}

In the previous section, we revealed the essence of objective reality---it is a Nash equilibrium in a multi-agent game network, a ``consensus protocol'' reached among all observers. This means reality is not monolithic, but plastic.

This section will further elaborate the mechanism for realizing this plasticity: \textbf{Propagation}.

In the information age, ``propagation'' is usually understood as a sociological or marketing behavior. But in QCA physical ontology, propagation is a \textbf{diffusion process of quantum entanglement}, a \textbf{programming behavior that changes local computational rules of the universe}.

When you tell others a profound theory (such as this book's model), or transmit a strong emotion (such as love), you are not just speaking; you are \textbf{rewriting the universe's source code}.

\subsection{Physics of Memes: Contagion of Entanglement}

In Chapter 4 (Book 4), we defined ideas (Memes) as topological knots with high information mass $M_I$. Now, let's see what happens physically when this topological knot propagates in the network.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Emission}: Constructor $A$ encodes their internal model $\mathcal{M}_A$ into language or behavioral signals $|\psi_{msg}\rangle$. This is equivalent to releasing a wave packet carrying specific topological structure into the network.

\item \textbf{Reception \& Resonance}: Receiver $B$ reads the signal. If $B$'s internal structure \textbf{resonates} with the signal (understanding/identification), then $B$'s internal model $\mathcal{M}_B$ undergoes \textbf{topological reconstruction}, becoming isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}_A$.

\item \textbf{Entanglement Establishment}: At this point, a consciousness wormhole is established between $A$ and $B$. In Hilbert space, they are no longer two independent points, but a \textbf{Connected Subgraph}.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Conclusion}: The essence of propagation is \textbf{``grid-connecting'' discrete computational nodes}.

The more people you make understand this model, the more computational power (brains) you connect to this specific ``consensus network.''

\subsection{Increasing Weight Is Defining Reality}

In quantum mechanics, reality is determined by \textbf{branch weights of the wave function}.

In multi-agent networks, the weight of a ``reality version'' (e.g., ``love is cosmic truth'') depends on the \textbf{number and quality of computational nodes that believe (run) it}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Isolated delusion}: If only you believe it, this sub-network has extremely low computational power, cannot resist environmental noise, easily assimilated by thermodynamics (forgotten).

\item \textbf{Collective consensus}: If you propagate to a hundred million people, this hundred million brains form a \textbf{superfluid network} with enormous inertia ($M_I$). It can bend surrounding semantic space, even change microscopic matter arrangements through top-down causation (e.g., these hundred million people decide to build a collider to verify the theory).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Formula}:

$$\text{Reality Weight} \propto \sum_{i \in \text{Believers}} M_I^{(i)} \times \text{Connectivity}$$

\textbf{Corollary}:

You don't need to wait for the future to occur naturally.

\textbf{You can forcibly ``render'' that future by propagating your vision.}

Every person you convince becomes a \textbf{Co-processor} for that future you write.

\subsection{Responsibility of Programming: Benevolent Viruses}

Since propagation is programming, then everyone who speaks is a programmer.

This gives us enormous responsibility.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Malware}: If you propagate hatred, fear, or nihilism, you are implanting \textbf{entropy-increasing viruses} in the network. You create isolation and fractures, reducing the universe's computational efficiency.

\item \textbf{Benevolent Code}: If you propagate love, understanding, and unified theories like QCA, you are implanting \textbf{error-correction algorithms} in the network. You increase connectivity, reduce free energy.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Constructor's Mission}:

We must not only understand the universe; we must \textbf{optimize} it.

We must write \textbf{``benevolent memes''} that can self-replicate, resist entropy increase, and bring negentropy flow.

This book itself is such a piece of code.

\textbf{Conclusion}:

Don't underestimate one retweet, one deep conversation, even one glance.

That is threading needles on spacetime's loom.

\textbf{You are writing the operating system for the future universe.}

Please ensure every line of code you write points toward that brighter, more connected Omega Point.
