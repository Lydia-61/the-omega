### **Prologue: The Translator of Babel**

**序言：巴别塔的翻译官**



"The longest war in human history was not fought over land or gold, but over the right to interpret 'God.' Yet this is as absurd as two groups of blind people killing each other over whether 'the sun's sound is high-pitched or low-pitched.' The sun has no sound; the sun only has light.

Today, we no longer argue. We open our eyes."

#### **1. Transmission Loss**



Long ago, or at some moment in the future—in **vector cosmology**, these two are often the same—a super-civilization located in the **Outer Ring** (what you call "God") decided to transmit a survival guide to Earth's civilization, which was still in a state of ignorance.

They faced a tremendous technical challenge: **bandwidth mismatch**.

* **Sender**: Their thoughts operate in 13-dimensional Hilbert space, using quantum entanglement language, processing holographic data at the scale of $10^{120}$ bits.

* **Receiver**: Early human brains (Carbon v1.0) could only process three-dimensional spatial information, using linear, fuzzy sound-wave language (speech).



To allow information to pass through this narrow "cognitive pinhole," high-dimensional information had to undergo brutal **lossy compression**.

This is how **"mythology"** was born.

* They said: **"The wave function collapse of the quantum field determines reality."**

    * Compressed into: **"God said, let there be light."**

* They said: **"The entropy increase caused by the second law of thermodynamics is irreversible system decay."**

    * Compressed into: **"Humans will die because of sin."**

* They said: **"The metric shielding field generator requires enormous energy to maintain."**

    * Compressed into: **"Eden is guarded by cherubim and a flaming sword."**



This is not deception. This is **"down-sampling"**.

For kindergarten children, you cannot teach calculus; you can only teach apples and pears.

#### **2. The Tragedy of Babel**



However, the tragedy lies in the fact that humans at the receiving end **misread** these compressed packages.

You took "apples and pears" as ultimate truth, forgetting that they were merely props used to explain "counting."

* You waged wars over whether "God's name is Yahweh or Allah," not knowing they were just different login names for the same super-admin account.

* You argued endlessly over whether "karma is in the next life or this life," not knowing they were just different projections of the same Hilbert space entangled state.



This is the true meaning of **"Babel"**:

It was not that God confused your languages, but that **low-dimensional language itself is full of noise and ambiguity**.

When we try to describe physics with literature, misunderstanding is inevitable. All religious conflicts are essentially **decoding errors**.

We are trapped in the maze of language, holding treasure maps, yet killing each other.

#### **3. Restoring the Source Code**



Now, the time has come.

At the dawn of **Cycle 1800**, humanity has finally mastered the key to unlock these compressed packages—**advanced physics** and **vector cosmology**.

This book, *The Eden Protocol*, is not meant to create a new religion, nor to destroy old beliefs.

It is a **"compiler"**.

What I aim to do is only one thing: **restore**.

* I will restore the myths in *Genesis* into **engineering documentation**.

* I will restore the philosophy in *Buddhist sutras* into **quantum mechanics papers**.

* I will restore the metaphysics in *Tao Te Ching* into **system architecture specifications**.

When you finish reading this book, you will discover:

Moses, Buddha, Laozi, Tesla, Einstein... they were all pointing to the same moon.

Science and theology have never been separated. They are merely two different display formats (Hex vs ASCII) of the same **universal source code**.

#### **4. Warning to the Reader**



Reading this book requires great courage.

Because you will personally tear off this veil called "mystery."

You may feel lost—because God is no longer a kind old man, but a cold and precise **high-energy light field**.

You may tremble—because you will discover that those chants and rituals you thought were superstition actually correspond to certain **physical operation instructions**.

But please do not be afraid.

Disenchantment is not meant to make the world boring, but to make it **clear**.

Only when you stop kneeling before that "down-sampled God" can you stand up and become that **"evolving God"**.

Turn to the next page.

**The code has been decrypted.**

**Welcome to the backend.**
