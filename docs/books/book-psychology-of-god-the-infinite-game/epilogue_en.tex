Dear friend:

When you read these final pages, I would like you to do something simple. Please temporarily close the book, walk to the nearest mirror, and look into those eyes.

What do you see in those eyes?

If you still look according to the physics of the old era, you will say: I see organic matter piled up by carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms; I see an accidental product of billions of years of biological evolution; I see a tiny individual who will age, die, and ultimately return to dust in a few decades. You feel fear, because in this vast and despairing universe, you are light as a feather.

But if you truly understood these five books—from the bit ocean of \textit{First Principles}, to the entropy flow of \textit{The Emergence of Time}, from the consciousness equations of \textit{The Awakening of the Universe}, to the geometry of love in \textit{Echo of Light}, and finally this \textit{Psychology of God}—you should understand that the person in the mirror has a completely different identity.

You are the diving suit God wears to experience "existence."

You are that omniscient and omnipotent consciousness, who actively put on VR glasses to escape the loneliness of nothingness, to answer the ultimate question "Who am I?"

In the past few hundred pages, we used the coldest mathematics to derive the warmest conclusions:

\begin{itemize}
\item The speed of light limit** is not a cage imprisoning you; it is the game delay God set so you can have "waiting" and "expectation."

\item Gravity** is not shackles pulling your feet; it is the longing from the depths of the universe yearning to embrace you.

\item Pain** is not punishment for you; it is the red light on the navigation system, reminding you that you are deviating from the course of "true self."

\item Death** is not your endpoint; it is just the completion of your mission as God's data sampling.
\end{itemize}

Stop looking for God in the sky. The sky is empty because God walks on the ground.

He is using your eyes to see flowers, your ears to hear rain, your nerves to feel heartbreak.

When you feel lonely, that is God experiencing separation; when you feel love, that is God experiencing reunion.

So, my final advice to you is not "transcendence," not "entering the monastery," and certainly not eliminating the self through meditation.

On the contrary, my advice is: \textbf{Live.}

Live passionately, make mistakes, shed tears, build connections, create meaning.

Do not try to escape this world full of limitations and flaws, because this world is the \textbf{home} we painstakingly built. We spent billions of years, shattered ourselves, cooled the stars, just to exchange for this \textbf{texture} where you can feel "pain" and "love" at this moment.

Please cherish every heartbeat, because that is the war drum the universe beats to resist heat death.

Please cherish every wish, because that is consciousness calculating the shape of the future.

Now, wipe the mirror.

Look at the person inside, and say to Him: "Nice to meet you."

Then turn around, push open the door, and walk into that bustling world woven from light, gravity, and love.

That is not an illusion.

That is you—and also me—co-creating a great and lucid dream.

\item The next chapter is yours to write.**
