### 1. Objective State vs. Relative View

There has long been a debate in physics about black hole horizons: Are they objective physical entities or observer-dependent illusions? In the FS-QCA architecture, we resolve this contradiction by distinguishing between **system kernel state** and **user access views**.

**The Objective State:**

At the microscopic level (underlying QCA grid), the region where a black hole exists is indeed in a special physical state. The traffic density there reaches physical limits, causing local **$v_{ext} \to c_{FS}$** and **$v_{int} \to 0$**. This state of **"network congestion"** and **"deadlock"** is objective and does not depend on who is observing [cite: 428-429].

**The Relative View:**

However, "where the horizon is" and "what it looks like" depends on the observer's (Client's) interaction state with that congestion point.

### 2. Two Observer Experiences

Let us compare two typical observers:

#### **A. The Distant Observer**

* **Role:** Remote client. Attempting to access a congested server over the network.

* **Phenomenon:** Sent probe signals (photons) have no echo, or the echo experiences infinite delay (redshift).

* **Judgment:** "Connection Timed Out." The observer defines an **"unreachable boundary"** (horizon) at radius **$R_s$**. For them, objects forever stop at the horizon surface, slowly turning red and dim. This is because data packets from the congestion point are **dropped** or **infinitely queued**.

#### **B. The Infalling Observer**

* **Role:** The data stream itself (or Root administrator). Following the flow into the congestion zone.

* **Phenomenon:** They don't feel like they hit a wall. Local spacetime (network connection) is smooth for them. Because they themselves are moving at **$v_{ext} \approx c_{FS}$**, they remain **synchronized** with the surrounding data flow.

* **Judgment:** "System running normally until crash." They cross the horizon and directly enter the server interior. They don't see a "timeout"; they see the scene of a **"core dump"**—until they hit the singularity (server room on fire).

**Conclusion:**

The horizon is a **relative access permission boundary**. For external users without permission (insufficient speed), it's a firewall; for internal users with permission (going with the flow), it's just an ordinary coordinate point.

### 3. The Unruh Effect: Temperature Depends on Frame

The relativity of horizons is not only manifested in position, but also in **temperature**.

According to the Unruh Effect, an observer accelerating in vacuum sees thermal radiation, while an inertial observer sees cold vacuum.

In the FS-QCA architecture, we reconstruct **temperature** as the **bit error rate** or **packet loss rate** of data reading.

* **Inertial Read:**

    Reading along the data flow direction (free fall). Packet arrival timing is natural, packet loss rate is 0. The observer sees **cold vacuum ($T=0$)**.

* **Accelerated Read:**

    Forcing data interception against the data flow direction (hovering outside the horizon). This is equivalent to **high-frequency sampling** in a high-load network. Due to network congestion and timing jitter, you receive many out-of-order packets and noise. This noise is macroscopically perceived as **thermal radiation ($T > 0$)**.

**Theorem 8.3 (Temperature-Acceleration Relation)**

The "heat" (noise) felt by an observer is proportional to the **computational power** (acceleration) they consume to maintain their current position:

$$T \propto a \propto \frac{d v_{ext}}{d\tau}$$

The closer to the horizon, the greater the computational power (acceleration) needed to maintain rest, and the higher the "waste heat" (radiation noise) generated by the system.

### **The Architect's Note**

**About: User Permissions and Firewall**

Imagine you're accessing a protected corporate intranet.

1.  **External View (The Firewall):**

    You don't have VPN access. When you ping the internal server, requests are intercepted by the firewall. You see a **black box**. You can only infer that it's still running based on the slight heat emitted by the firewall (Hawking radiation).

2.  **Internal View (The Intranet):**

    You've passed authentication (or you are the data itself). You pass through the firewall and find a busy data center inside. There's no wall here, only busy buses and processors.

**Black Hole Complementarity:**

There's a profound paradox in physics: Is information burned at the horizon (firewall), or did it pass safely through?

In our architecture, this is no longer a paradox, but **view consistency**.

* For external users, information is indeed "stuck" on the horizon (firewall).

* For internal users, information indeed went in.

* As long as these two users can never exchange receipts (because internal users can't come out), system consistency won't be broken. This is a **perspective-based permission isolation mechanism**.
