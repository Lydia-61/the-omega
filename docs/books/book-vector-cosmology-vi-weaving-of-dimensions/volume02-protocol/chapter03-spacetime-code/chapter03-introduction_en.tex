\section{Chapter 3: Spacetime as Code}

At the beginning of Volume II, we raised a core question: Why does spacetime woven from fragile quantum entanglement exhibit such astonishing stability?

The answer lies hidden in information theory and quantum error correction theory.

This chapter will reveal that the physical reality we perceive---from gravity to electromagnetic force, from spacetime curvature to material motion---is essentially the macroscopic manifestation of a set of \textbf{quantum error correction protocols} running at the bottom of the universe.

We will see that physical laws are not ``laws of nature''; they are \textbf{``checking algorithms''}. Spacetime is not a container; it is \textbf{``redundant encoding''}.
