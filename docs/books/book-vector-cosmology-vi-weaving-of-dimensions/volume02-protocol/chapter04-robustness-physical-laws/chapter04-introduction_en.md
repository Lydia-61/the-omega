# Chapter 4: Robustness and Physical Laws

In the previous chapter, we not only revealed that spacetime is a holographic projection, but also pointed out that it is essentially a set of **Code**. If the universe is code, it must face the oldest and deadliest threat in computer science: **Errors**.

Quantum fluctuations, environmental thermal noise, bit flips... At the Planck scale, the microscopic world is full of chaotic randomness. In principle, a system composed of such fragile components should crash (freeze) in the first second of operation.

However, our universe exhibits astonishing **Robustness**. Rocks are hard, planetary orbits are stable, atoms remain intact for billions of years.

Why? Because the universe is not just running; it is also **self-checking**.

This chapter will reveal that those cold physical laws we learn in textbooks—energy conservation, momentum conservation, charge conservation—actually have a hidden identity. They are **Checksum Algorithms** running in the universe's underlying operating system to prevent data corruption.
