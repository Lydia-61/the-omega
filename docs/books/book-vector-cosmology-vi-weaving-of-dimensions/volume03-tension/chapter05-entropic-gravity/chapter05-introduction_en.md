# Chapter 5: Entropic Gravity

At the beginning of Volume III, we raised a core question: What happens when we place mass into the spacetime network woven from entanglement threads?

The answer lies hidden in the deep connection between thermodynamics and information theory.

This chapter will reveal that the gravity we perceive—from falling apples to planetary orbits—is essentially the **Entropic Force** produced by the cosmic entanglement network to maintain maximum entropy.

We will see that gravity is not a fundamental force; it is statistical, thermodynamic, and emergent.
