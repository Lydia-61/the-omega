\section{Part III: Tension --- The Thermodynamics of Gravity}

In the first two volumes, we wove the skeleton of space (tensor networks) and verified its solidity (quantum error correction). Now, we must apply \textbf{force} to this static geometric structure.

When we throw a huge mass (such as a star) into this net woven from entanglement threads, what happens?

The net will sag. The threads will be pulled tight.

A \textbf{``Tension''} trying to restore the original state will propagate through the network.

This tension, in macroscopic physics, has a resounding name---\textbf{Gravity}.

This volume will subvert our traditional understanding of gravity. We will prove that gravity is not a fundamental interaction force; it does not need to exchange ``gravitons.'' Gravity is the \textbf{``elastic recoil''} produced when the spacetime fabric is subjected to \textbf{information pressure}. It is a \textbf{thermodynamic response} made by the universe to maintain maximum entanglement entropy.
