\section{Chapter 6: Fluid Dynamics of Horizons}

In the previous chapter, we reconstructed gravity as ``information pressure.'' But this brings a new physical picture: if spacetime is a fabric woven from billions of entanglement threads, and mass exerts pressure on it, then this fabric is not just ``curved''; it is also \textbf{``flowing''}.

In the depths of modern physics, there exists a chilling mathematical isomorphism between Einstein's field equations and fluid dynamics equations. Spacetime is not just like a fluid; spacetime \textbf{is} a fluid.

This chapter will reveal the fluid dynamics essence of \textbf{Vector Cosmology}. We will see that the \textbf{Navier-Stokes Equation}, originally used to describe water flow and air, actually governs the evolution of black hole horizons. The universe is not a vacuum; the universe is a viscous \textbf{quantum ether}.
