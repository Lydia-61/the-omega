# Chapter 6: Fluid Dynamics of Horizons

In the previous chapter, we reconstructed gravity as "information pressure." But this brings a new physical picture: if spacetime is a fabric woven from billions of entanglement threads, and mass exerts pressure on it, then this fabric is not just "curved"; it is also **"flowing"**.

In the depths of modern physics, there exists a chilling mathematical isomorphism between Einstein's field equations and fluid dynamics equations. Spacetime is not just like a fluid; spacetime **is** a fluid.

This chapter will reveal the fluid dynamics essence of **Vector Cosmology**. We will see that the **Navier-Stokes Equation**, originally used to describe water flow and air, actually governs the evolution of black hole horizons. The universe is not a vacuum; the universe is a viscous **quantum ether**.
