# Chapter 7: Black Holes: Max-Flow Min-Cut

At the beginning of Volume IV, we raised a core question: What happens when information exceeds the carrying limit of the spacetime network?

The answer lies hidden in the deep connection between network theory and information theory.

This chapter will reveal that black holes are not abysses that devour everything, but traffic control valves of the cosmic network. We will see that event horizons are the minimum cuts in the network, and black hole interiors are madly growing computational universes.
