\section{Chapter 9: ER = EPR}

At the beginning of Volume V, we raised a core question: Can we suture two distant regions together by artificially creating entanglement?

The answer lies hidden in the deepest coincidence in the history of physics.

This chapter will reveal that the two papers Einstein wrote in 1935---one about wormholes (ER), one about entanglement (EPR)---actually describe the same thing. Wormholes are entanglement; entanglement is wormholes. This is the universe's ``backend channel.''
