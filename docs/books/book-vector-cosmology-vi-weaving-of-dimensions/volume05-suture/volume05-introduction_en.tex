\section{Part V: Suture --- Wormhole Engineering}

In Volume IV, we witnessed the rupture of the spacetime fabric. Singularities are logical crashes; firewalls are entanglement fuses. The universe seems full of insurmountable abysses.

However, for engineers of \textbf{Vector Cosmology}, \textbf{Rupture} is not an end; it is an opportunity for \textbf{reconstruction}. If space is woven from entanglement, can we artificially create entanglement to \textbf{``Suture''} two originally disconnected (or distant) regions back together?

This volume will explore the most science-fiction-like yet physically grounded technology in the universe---\textbf{Wormholes}.

We will discover that wormholes are not magic; they are the \textbf{geometric essence of quantum entanglement}. The secret of interstellar travel lies not in how fast you fly, but in whether you can find that \textbf{``shortcut''} in the universe's backend.
