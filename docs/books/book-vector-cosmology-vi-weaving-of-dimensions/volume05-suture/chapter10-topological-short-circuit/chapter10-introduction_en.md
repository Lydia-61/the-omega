# Chapter 10: Topological Short-Circuit

In the previous chapter, we explored the possibility of constructing wormholes (ER bridges) by creating macroscopic black holes. Although theoretically feasible, engineering-wise, it requires astronomical amounts of negative energy and extreme manipulation of spacetime curvature. For even Type II civilizations, this is expensive infrastructure just for "paving roads."

Is there a lighter, more "software-like" method?

If we don't need to bend spacetime or dig tunnels, but directly use the underlying **entanglement network** of the universe to "cut" an object's information from point A and "paste" it at point B?

This chapter will explore the macro-engineering of **Quantum Teleportation**.

We will see that the ultimate form of interstellar travel is not spaceship navigation, but **topological short-circuiting**. We don't need to overcome distance; we only need to **reconstruct** existence.
