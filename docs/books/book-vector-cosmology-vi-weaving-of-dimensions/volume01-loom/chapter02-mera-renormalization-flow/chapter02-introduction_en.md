# Chapter 2: MERA and Renormalization Flow

In the previous chapter, we stitched together flat space using "entanglement threads." But this is not enough. If the universe were merely a flat two-dimensional grid, it could not explain why we have the concept of "scale." Why are atoms smaller than us? Why are galaxies larger than us? Why do physical laws appear self-similar at different scales?

To construct a universe that has not only breadth but also **depth**, we need to introduce a more advanced weaving technique.

This is **MERA (Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz)**.

This chapter will reveal that the spacetime structure of the universe is not a flat fishing net, but an upside-down growing **Fractal Tree**.
