\section{Chapter 1: The Threads of Entanglement}

In the prologue, we dismantled the classical illusion of ``space as container'' and established a new picture of ``space as relational network.'' Now, we must delve into the microscopic texture of this network.

If the universe is a piece of fabric, what is the smallest unit constituting this fabric---those ``threads'' that stitch the void together?

Physics gives the answer: \textbf{Bell Pairs}.

This chapter will reveal how entanglement---the most bizarre phenomenon in quantum mechanics---emerges at the macroscopic scale as the geometric space we depend on for survival. We will see that distance is not a chasm separating us; distance is merely the manifestation of the threads connecting us being stretched thin.
