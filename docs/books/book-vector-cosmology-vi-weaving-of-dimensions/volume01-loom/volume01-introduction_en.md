# Part I: The Loom — The Geometry of Entanglement

In the prologue, we established a new picture of space: space is not a container, but a fabric woven by wave functions. Now, we must delve into the interior of this loom to see how it works.

If space is a piece of fabric, then this loom is the **Tensor Network**.

This volume will reveal how the universe uses **Entanglement Entropy** as glue, bonding discrete qubits (pixels) into continuous geometric space. We will see that the famous **Area Law** and **Holographic Principle** are essentially counts of the "number of thread ends" in this cosmic fabric.
