# Appendix A: Geometric Derivation of Holographic Entanglement Entropy

In Volume I "The Loom" of **Vector Cosmology VI**, we proposed a core viewpoint: **Space is woven from entanglement**. In particular, we cited the famous **Ryu-Takayanagi Formula**, stating that the entanglement entropy $S_A$ of a region equals the area $\text{Area}(\gamma_A)$ of the minimal surface in its holographic dual space divided by $4G$.

This appendix will provide the mathematical derivation framework behind this holy grail of physics. We will show how, starting from pure quantum information theory (von Neumann entropy), through the **Replica Trick** and **path integrals**, we naturally derive the geometric area law in general relativity.

This is mathematical ironclad evidence that **"geometry emerges from information"**.

## A.1 Von Neumann Entropy and the Replica Trick

First, we define the entropy of a quantum system. For a density matrix $\rho_A$ in a mixed state, its **von Neumann entropy** is defined as:

$$S_A = -\text{Tr}(\rho_A \ln \rho_A)$$

Directly calculating $\ln \rho_A$ is very difficult (involving matrix logarithms). To solve this problem, physicists introduced the **Replica Trick**.

Instead of directly calculating the logarithm, we calculate the trace of the $n$-th power of $\rho_A$ (i.e., Rényi entropy), then take the derivative with respect to $n$:

$$S_A = -\lim_{n \to 1} \frac{\partial}{\partial n} \text{Tr}(\rho_A^n)$$

**Physical Picture:**

* **$\text{Tr}(\rho_A^n)$** means we **"stitch"** $n$ identical copies of the universe (Replicas) together at the boundary of region A.

* This stitching creates a **"Conical Singularity"** in spacetime geometry.

## A.2 Geometric Proof of the Ryu-Takayanagi Formula

Under the framework of **AdS/CFT duality**, the partition function $Z_{CFT}$ of the boundary field theory (CFT) is equivalent to the partition function $Z_{gravity}$ of the bulk gravitational theory (AdS).

$$Z_{CFT} \approx e^{-S_{gravity}}$$

When we calculate $\text{Tr}(\rho_A^n)$, we introduce a **Twist Operator** on the boundary.

In the bulk of the holographic dual, this boundary twist condition extends inward, forming a **"Minimal Surface"** $\gamma_A$.

According to the action principle of general relativity, the system always tends to find configurations with minimum energy (or area).

When we stitch $n$ copies together on the boundary, the spacetime geometry in the bulk responds, trying to connect these $n$ layers at minimum cost.

Mathematical derivation shows that in the limit $n \to 1$, the dominant term of entropy is exactly proportional to the area of this minimal surface:

$$S_A = \frac{\text{Area}(\gamma_A)}{4 G_N}$$

* **$\text{Area}(\gamma_A)$**: Is the area of the minimal surface hanging from the boundary of region A in the higher-dimensional bulk space, like a soap film.

* **$G_N$**: Is Newton's gravitational constant.

* **$4$**: Is a geometric factor.

**Conclusion:**

This formula proves that **quantum entanglement (entropy)** is not an abstract number; it is **real spacetime geometric area**.

Each bit of entanglement occupies a spacetime cross-section of size $4G_N$. This is the microscopic fiber density of the **"spacetime fabric"**.

## A.3 MERA Networks and Discrete AdS Space

The Ryu-Takayanagi formula is a result in the continuous limit. In the microscopic QCA model of **Vector Cosmology**, we focus more on discrete structures.

This involves **MERA (Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz)** tensor networks.

MERA networks construct a fractal tree structure through layered stacking of **Disentanglers** and **Isometries**.

If we calculate the entanglement entropy between two regions in a MERA network, we need to cut the connection bonds in the network.

**Theorem:**

In MERA networks, the number of **Minimum Cuts** connecting region A with its complement, in the macroscopic limit, precisely corresponds to the **geodesic length** (for 1+1 dimensional boundaries) or **minimal surface area** (for higher-dimensional boundaries) in AdS space.

$$S_{MERA}(A) \sim \min \#(\text{Cut Bonds}) \sim \text{Area}(\gamma_A)$$

This not only verifies the holographic principle but also reveals the **mechanism of dimensional emergence**:

* **Horizontal connections**: Constitute the breadth of physical space.

* **Longitudinal layers (renormalization steps)**: Constitute the additional **holographic dimension** (AdS radial direction).

**The "depth" ($z$-axis) we perceive is essentially the "logical steps" from leaves (microscopic) to roots (macroscopic) in the MERA network.**
