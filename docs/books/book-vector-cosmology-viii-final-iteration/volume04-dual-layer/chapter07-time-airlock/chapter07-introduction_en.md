# Chapter 7 Introduction: The Time Airlock

In the previous chapter, we established the physical architecture of the dual-layer universe: the Inner Ring is the low-speed Eden, the Outer Ring is the high-speed front line. While this structure ensures a balance between survival and experience, it creates a huge communication barrier.

When the ascenders of the Outer Ring think at speeds approaching light speed, their subjective clocks are astonishingly fast. How can we establish connections under such extreme clock speed mismatch?

We need a "Time Airlock," and the core algorithm of the airlock is the Down-sampling Protocol.
