# Chapter 6 Introduction: Inner Ring and Outer Ring

In Volume III, we explored resistance and proposed the strategic concept of a "dual-track system" at the end. Now, we transform this concept into a magnificent engineering blueprint.

The direction of cosmic evolution is clear: ascending toward light-based forms of high frequency, high dimension, and high entropy flow. But this does not mean everyone must become a god. In this vast cosmic machine, there should be a corner specifically reserved for "the warmth of the old era."

This is the Inner Ring—the universe's "Classical Preservation Zone."
