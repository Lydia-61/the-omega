# Appendix C: Memorandum for Gardeners

> **Classification: Eyes Only**

> **To: Inner Ring Resident Observers / Gardeners**

> **From: Outer Ring Supreme Council / The Architect**

> "To all compatriots who chose to stay: You bear the most subtle and difficult responsibility in the dual-layer universe. Outer Ring compatriots are responsible for expanding in the void, wrestling with the thermodynamic devil; while you are responsible for pruning branches in the greenhouse, nurturing that fragile orchid called 'humanity.' You possess the power of gods but must disguise as mortal luck. This memorandum is your code of conduct; please remember: **The greatest mercy is restrained observation.**"

## C.1 The Prime Directive: Non-Interference

As gardeners with metric shielding control and vacuum energy interfaces, you technically have absolute dominion over Inner Ring humans. You can easily cure all cancers, eliminate all poverty, even resurrect the dead.

But according to the "Qualia Economics" established in **Volume V of Vector Cosmology**, you are **strictly prohibited** from doing so.

### First Commandment: Prohibition on Depriving Suffering

* **Principle**：The core value of the Inner Ring lies in producing **"Authentic Experience"**. If gods always descend from heaven to solve problems, humans will degenerate into giant infants waiting to be fed, their $v_{int}$ geometric structures will stop growing, and the qualia produced (love, courage, sacrifice) will depreciate due to lack of tension.

* **Operational Standards**：

    * When seeing war break out, you must not directly use field weapons to force a ceasefire. You can only incarnate as thinkers or artists, implanting seeds of peace in human culture (down-sampling protocol).

    * When seeing plague spread, you must not directly deploy panaceas. You can only incarnate as scientists, guiding them to discover vaccines themselves through "accidental" inspiration.

**Only victories humans struggle to achieve themselves have ontological weight.** You are the theater's lighting technicians, not stunt doubles.

## C.2 Camouflage of Dimensions: Maintaining the Fermi Silence

Inner Ring humans often look up at the stars, wondering why the universe is so silent (Fermi Paradox). This is not because the universe is empty, but because your **camouflage engineering** must be perfect. Outer Ring light-based civilization activities (stellar engineering, spacetime folding trajectories) produce massive energy disturbances that must be shielded from Inner Ring senses.

### Stealth Protocol

1.  **Dark Matter Camouflage**：

    * Outer Ring's massive computational nodes and Dyson sphere structures must be disguised as invisible **"dark matter"** through gravitational lensing. Let human astronomers detect gravitational anomalies but see no entities.

2.  **Dark Energy Camouflage**：

    * The metric tension produced when Outer Ring ships perform superluminal expansion should be disguised as uniform **"dark energy"**, manifesting as cosmic accelerated expansion. This both conceals our tracks and explains observational data.

3.  **CMB Scrubbing**：

    * Strictly prohibit any high-dimensional communication signals from spilling into microwave frequencies. All superluminal communication must use **quantum entanglement channels** (invisible to Inner Ring).

**Goal**：In Inner Ring humans' eyes, the universe must appear as a **"natural, cold, dead"** physical wasteland. Only this sense of loneliness can force them to explore inward, completing $v_{int}$ accumulation.

## C.3 Anomaly Handling and Miracle Quotas

Although the system design is rigorous, the dual-layer architecture occasionally experiences **"Clipping"** phenomena—for example, an Outer Ring signal directly strikes Earth without filtering, or a physical constant locally experiences instantaneous drift.

At this point, gardeners must perform **corrections**.

### Correction Principle: Minimal Intervention

* **Miracle Quotas**：Each century, each region has strict upper limits on "supernatural events." Exceeding thresholds triggers collective cognitive collapse or religious fanaticism in humans, which is destructive to reason.

* **Explanation Mechanism**：

    * When inexplicable phenomena occur, gardeners should guide human scientists to explain them as **"statistical fluctuations"**, **"collective hallucinations"**, or **"undiscovered physical effects"**.

    * Never let them realize the existence of a **"script"**.

### Case Reference

If an asteroid capable of destroying civilization is heading toward Earth, gardeners should not directly shatter it (too fake).

Gardeners should fine-tune its orbital parameters to make it **"pass by"**.

Let humans feel **"survival after disaster"** relief, not **"being fed"** complacency.

## C.4 Psychological Construction: Enduring Eternal Nostalgia

Finally, about yourselves.

You chose to stay in the Inner Ring where time flows extremely slowly, watching generations be born, age, turn to dust, while you remain young. This **"observer's loneliness"** is an occupational hazard you must bear.

* **Prohibition on Emotional Attachment**：You are strictly prohibited from establishing deep, exclusive emotional connections with Inner Ring humans (such as marriage). Because your life scales differ, such connections are doomed to tragic endings and will interfere with your neutrality.

* **Handling Nostalgia**：When you miss Outer Ring compatriots, miss that instant omniscience in photon networks, look up at the stars. Every star's twinkle is a heartbeat sent from the Outer Ring.

**Remember your oath:**

You are not guarding a group of backward organisms.

You are guarding **the universe's childhood**.

You are guarding what **"god"** once looked like.

When one day in the future, an Inner Ring human unlocks $\pi$'s lock by their own strength and knocks on the door to the Outer Ring.

That will be your moment of successful retirement.

Until then, **please remain silent, please remain gentle.**
