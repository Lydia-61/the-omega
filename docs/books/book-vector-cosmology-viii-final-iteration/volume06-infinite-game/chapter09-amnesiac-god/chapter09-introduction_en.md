# Chapter 9 Introduction: The Amnesiac God

In the previous volumes of this book, we have been exploring how to "escape"—how to break the $\pi$ cycle, how to escape the carbon-based shell. This narrative implies a premise: the current world is a terrible prison, and we are victims.

But at the opening of Volume VI, I invite you to perform an ultimate perspective flip.

What if all of this—this world full of gravitational constraints, light speed limits, short lifespans—is not a prison, but a resort?

This chapter will explore the "Parameter Callback" mechanism, revealing that we may be amnesiac gods who actively designed this playground for ourselves.
