# Chapter 10 Introduction: One Season Only

In the final chapter of Volume VI, we will explore a most sensitive yet unavoidable topic: when death is technically overcome, when consciousness can iterate continuously across $\tau$ cycles, what qualitative transformation will humanity's oldest mission—reproduction—undergo?

From the perspective of Vector Cosmology, this is a great transformation from "horizontal inheritance" to "vertical inheritance."

This chapter will explore the end of intergenerational transfer and the birth of vertical inheritance when individuals become immortals.
