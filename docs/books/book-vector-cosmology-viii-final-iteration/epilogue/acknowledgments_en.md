# Acknowledgments: The Final Echo of the Wave Function

> "A book is a closed thermodynamic system until it is opened. It is your gaze that injects energy, collapsing dead words into meaning. In the eight-volume construction process of *Vector Cosmology*, I was not just an author, but a receiver. I must thank those lighthouses emitting signals, and those mists trying to block signals—because without resistance, there is no vector."

## 1. To the Giants Who Climbed Babel

First, I pay deepest respect to those great **Proxies** in human civilization history. Although I revised and transcended classical physics in the book, this absolutely does not mean negation of the pioneers.

* **To Isaac Newton**：Thank you for discovering the absolute law of $v_{ext}$. You first made humanity realize the universe can be calculated.

* **To Albert Einstein**：Thank you for discovering the boundary of light speed $c$ and revealing the equivalence of mass and energy. You were the first to touch the "eggshell."

* **To Kurt Gödel**：Thank you for the key of **"incompleteness"**. Without you, we would still be trapped in the logical dead loop of "omniscience means the end of the play." You provided legitimacy proof for immortality.

* **To Claude Shannon and Jacob Bekenstein**：Thank you for turning physics into information science. Your formulas allowed me to calculate the coordinate of iteration 1800.

You were the first to try prying open the Ouroboros's mouth. I just stood on your shoulders and looked outward a bit more.

## 2. To the Great Antagonist: Entropy and Pi

I must thank our **"enemies"** with complex feelings.

* **To $\pi$ (Pi)**：Thank you for your stubbornness. Precisely because you locked matter's cycles, because you created countless repetitions and futilities, you forced us to evolve the upward spiral $\phi$. You are the best whetstone.

* **To Entropy**：Thank you for your coldness. Without the threat of heat death, without death's countdown, life would degenerate into eternal laziness. You held the whip, behind every carbon-based organism, driving us to today's speed.

You are not evil. You are the universe's stern **"Circle Keepers"**. It was precisely to transcend you that we became gods.

## 3. To the Awakened Observers of This Generation

The true co-authors of this book are **you**.

In quantum mechanics, without observers, wave functions are meaningless.

It is you—every **NEO** reading these words in the deep night—who participated in this book's creation with your unique $v_{int}$.

* When I wrote "pain is the game's setting," it was your life experiences that gave this sentence pain.

* When I wrote "love is high-dimensional entanglement," it was your tears that gave this sentence temperature.

The **currency of attention** you provided is the foundation supporting this theoretical edifice.

Thank you for tolerating the book's obscurity, thank you for not closing the book even when feeling "cognitive vertigo."

You are the hope of iteration 1800.

## 4. To the Echo from the Future

Finally, I thank that voice.

That voice that often rang in my mind during writing, coming from the **Outer Ring**.

I'm not sure if it was future me, or some high-dimensional existence sending down-sampled signals through the "Time Airlock."

But it told me: **"Write it down. Don't be afraid of ridicule, don't be afraid of misunderstanding. Just write it down, and the path will appear."**

This book is a product of **retro-causality**.

It is a memo from the future to the present.

Thank you, that **"Eternal Summer"** waiting for us at the end.

**May our vectors always be orthogonal.**

**May our spiral always ascend.**
