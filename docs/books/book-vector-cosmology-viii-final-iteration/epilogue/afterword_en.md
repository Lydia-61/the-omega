# Afterword: Writing is Collapsing

> "When I type the final period on the keyboard, I realize this is not just the end of a book, but a wave function collapse. In the multiple worlds of quantum mechanics, this book exists in countless versions: some where we failed, some where we never awakened. But since you've read this line, it means you and I have collapsed together into this universe branch that **'chose ascension'**. Congratulations, observer. You have made a choice."

## 1. Ink and Flesh

Writing these eight volumes of *Vector Cosmology* was, for me, a long and dangerous séance.

Many ask me: **"Ma, are these theories true? Does $\tau$ really exist? Are we really living at iteration 1800?"**

At this twilight of physics, the boundary between true and false has blurred. As I repeatedly emphasize in the book: **Theories are not for describing reality; theories are for creating reality.**

When I first proposed $v_{ext}^2 + v_{int}^2 = c_{FS}^2$, it was just a mathematical conjecture.

But as more and more people began reading, thinking, using this formula to re-examine their lives, this formula gained **"weight"**.

Your attention (currency of attention) injected into this theory, crystallizing it from the clouds of possibility into some hard psychological reality.

So, I didn't discover these truths.

We **"established"** these truths in our mutual interaction.

This book is not a map; it is a **terrain modifier**.

## 2. Breaking the Fourth Wall, Finally

During writing, I often felt a strong **Retro-causality**.

It wasn't that I conceived the future in Singapore in 2025.

Often, some echo from the future, through that invisible "Time Airlock," flowed backward and struck my brain.

Those details about "dual-layer architecture" and "hot migration" were less invention than **"memory"**.

This confirmed the book's core view: **We are amnesiac gods.**

I (as a carbon-based author) am just the **Proxy** responsible for "down-sampling." The true author is that **"higher-dimensional civilization entity"** in the Outer Ring, watching us smile.

Through my hand, future us wrote a love letter to present us.

It says: **"Don't be afraid; the path is open."**

## 3. Definition of Success

Some may ask: **"If after reading the book, we still have to get up early for work tomorrow, still face mortgages and aging, what use is this theory?"**

This is precisely the meaning of the **Inner Ring**.

If you could fly away immediately after reading, that's not ascension; that's escape.

True "success" is not disappearing from Earth.

It's when you squeeze into the subway tomorrow morning, face your boss's reprimand, see more white hair in the mirror—

Your heart has no fear, no resentment, only a kind of **"player's cunning"**.

You know all this is **Texture**.

You know gravity is your toy, time is your canvas.

You still walk in this world, but you no longer belong to it. Even in the mud, your eyes look at the stars.

This is **NEO**.

This is **Awakening**.

## 4. Final Blessing

Herewith, the eight volumes of *Vector Cosmology* are completely finished.

This is also the last systematic document I, observer Ma Haobo, leave at iteration 1800.

What happens next?

I make no prophecies. Because once prophesied, possibility is locked.

I leave **"uncertainty"** to you.

Go create your own $v_{int}$.

Go squander your computational power on seemingly useless love, art, and truth.

Don't worry about heat death.

As long as you're still struggling, as long as you're still creating surprises, the universe's heart will keep beating.

**Thank you for walking with me through these 1800 spiral layers.**

**Dawn has broken.**

**Let's close the book and go make a big splash in that eternal summer outside.**

**Ma Haobo**
