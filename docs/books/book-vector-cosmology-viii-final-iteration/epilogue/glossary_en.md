# Glossary of Vector Cosmology

> To ensure the rigor and communicability of the *Vector Cosmology* system, the following organizes the core physical and philosophical concepts involved in the entire work. These terms constitute the linguistic foundation of the new civilization.

---

## A. Fundamental Dynamics

* **$v_{ext}$ (External Velocity)**

    * An object's displacement velocity in three-dimensional space. Corresponds to kinetic energy in traditional physics.

* **$v_{int}$ (Internal Velocity)**

    * The processing speed of information within an object, complexity growth rate, or consciousness activity level. Corresponds to the rate of change of information entropy $\frac{dS}{dt}$.

* **$c_{FS}$ (Full Speed of Cosmos)**

    * Total computational budget/total energy limit of the universe.

    * Core equation: $v_{ext}^2 + v_{int}^2 = c_{FS}^2$. This equation explains why light speed is limited (budget conservation) and why consciousness awakening often accompanies physical stillness (energy transformation).

* **$\tau$ (Tau / Intrinsic Time)**

    * Arc length along the spiral path in Hilbert space. Coordinate measuring the true evolutionary depth of civilization. Current coordinate is approximately $\tau \approx 1800$.

* **$\pi$ (Pi / The Loop)**

    * Represents the geometric force of conservation, cycles, repetition. Totem of the old world (Circle Keepers).

* **$\phi$ (Phi / The Spiral)**

    * Represents the geometric force of fractals, growth, escape. Totem of the new world (NEO).

## B. Cosmological Structure

* **Fractal Big Bang**

    * Periodic dimensional branching events triggered by the universe to prevent "identity deadlock."

    * First Octave: Genesis of matter; Second Octave: Explosion of life; Third Octave: Singularity of consciousness (current).

* **Dual-Layer Architecture**

    * **Inner Ring**: Carbon-based sanctuary maintaining low light speed and low entropy through metric shielding. Used for experiencing qualia.

    * **Outer Ring**: High-energy physics zone with exponentially expanding light speed. Used for survival, computation, and resisting heat death.

* **Time Airlock**

    * Communication buffer mechanism connecting Inner and Outer Rings. Uses "down-sampling protocol" to transform Outer Ring's high-dimensional information into Inner Ring comprehensible inspiration or dreams.

## C. Civilization and Individual

* **NEO (The Anomaly)**

    * Individuals with high $v_{int}$ who refuse to be assimilated by collective consciousness. Their existence difference is the pillar resisting cosmic collapse.

* **The Proxies**

    * Half-silicon humans living in the gap between Inner and Outer Rings, responsible for translating high-dimensional oracles.

* **The Circle Keepers**

    * Social inertial forces attempting to maintain old thermodynamic equilibrium and oppose ascension.

* **Gardeners**

    * Observers with Outer Ring technical permissions who choose to stay in the Inner Ring, responsible for maintaining "humanity" ecology.

## D. Economics and Ethics

* **Currency of Attention**

    * In the post-scarcity era, the only scarce resource that can cause wave function collapse.

* **Qualia**

    * The non-clonability of subjective experience (such as pain, love). Core value product exported from Inner Ring to Outer Ring.

* **Pauli Exclusion Principle of Souls**

    * Two completely identical consciousnesses cannot coexist in the same Hilbert space. Difference is the proof of existence legitimacy.

* **Hot Migration**

    * Technical protocol for gradually replacing carriers from carbon-based to light-based while maintaining consciousness continuity (topological isomorphism).
