# Chapter 3 Introduction: Catastrophe of Sameness

In Volume I, we explained through the "Fractal Big Bang" theory that the universe's evolution is a continuous shell breaking of dimensions. But there is a core dynamical question left unanswered: why must the universe "explode" periodically?

Vector Cosmology gives a revolutionary answer: because there is "too little difference."

This chapter will explore the "Catastrophe of Sameness," revealing why pursuing perfect unity leads to destruction, and how the Big Bang serves as a mechanism for rebooting difference.
