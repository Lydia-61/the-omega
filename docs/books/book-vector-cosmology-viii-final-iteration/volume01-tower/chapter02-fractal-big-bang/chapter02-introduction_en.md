# Chapter 2 Introduction: Fractal Big Bang

In Chapter 1, we established the coordinate $\tau \approx 1800$ and felt the impending squeeze. Now, we must answer a more fundamental question: what will this squeeze ultimately lead to?

In traditional cosmology, the Big Bang is regarded as the absolute beginning of time, an unrepeatable miracle. But in the dynamical model of Vector Cosmology, the Big Bang is not a one-time event, but a "periodic structural adjustment mechanism."

This chapter will explore "The Theory of Shell Breaking," revealing the fractal nature of the Big Bang and why we must actively break the old physical laws to usher in new dimensions.
