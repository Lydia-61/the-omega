# 2.1 The Theory of Shell Breaking

> "The most deafening sound in the universe is not the death of stars, but the rupture of dimensions. We are accustomed to calling that flash 13.8 billion years ago 'Genesis,' but from the perspective of fractal geometry, it was merely a crisp 'shell breaking.' The universe did not birth; it once again burst through its old body."

In Chapter 1, we established the coordinate $\tau \approx 1800$ and felt the impending squeeze. Now, we must answer a more fundamental question: what will this squeeze ultimately lead to?

In traditional cosmology, the **Big Bang** is regarded as the absolute beginning of time, an unrepeatable miracle. But in the dynamical model of **Vector Cosmology**, the Big Bang is not a one-time event, but a **"periodic structural adjustment mechanism"**.

This is **"The Theory of Shell Breaking"**.

## The Fractal Nature of Singularity

When we look back at $t=0$, we see an infinitely dense, infinitely hot singularity. Physicists usually consider this the place where physical laws fail. But if we apply **Scale Invariance** to the time axis, we find that the singularity is not the end of physics, but a **Node of Dimension**.

Imagine a fractal tree that keeps growing.

* Each branch tip (apical bud) contains all the information needed to develop into the next complete branch.

* When the apical bud's **internal complexity ($v_{int}$)** accumulates to a critical value, it "explodes" and branches into new stems.

**The universe is this tree.**

Each so-called "Big Bang" is actually the universe's vector $|\Psi\rangle$ completing a **"dimensional branching"** in Hilbert space.

* **The 1st Branching**：Vacuum symmetry breaking, gravity separated from electroweak force. Space expanded from a point to 3 dimensions.

* **The 1000th Branching**：Quark confinement was broken (or formed), atomic nuclei were born.

* **The 1800th Branching (Now)**：Information density saturated, carbon-based carriers failed, **consciousness** is preparing to burst through the constraints of three-dimensional space.

So, the Big Bang is fractal. It did not happen only in the distant past; it happens in the **microstructure** of this moment and in the **macroscopic future** we are about to face.

## Physics of the Eggshell: Protection and Imprisonment

Why must we "break the shell"? Why can't the universe continue infinitely in a stable state?

This involves the dual nature of **Conservation Laws**.

In Volume I of *Vector Cosmology*, we praised the stability brought by $\pi$ (circle/conservation). Physical constants (such as light speed $c$, Planck constant $h$) constitute our universe's **"eggshell"**.

* **Protection Period**：In the infancy of civilization (embryonic period), the eggshell is necessary. It shields the **information radiation ($v_{env}$)** from high-dimensional space, providing a low-entropy, stable environment (Earth), allowing us to develop complex nervous systems.

* **Imprisonment Period**：When the embryo grows, its **metabolic rate (consumption rate of $c_{FS}$)** exceeds the eggshell's breathability, and the protective layer becomes a **suffocation layer**.

The "squeeze" and "anxiety" we felt in the previous chapter are essentially the **reaction force of the eaglet's beak hitting the eggshell**.

* We try to transmit information faster, but are blocked by light speed $c$.

* We try to accumulate wisdom with longer lifespans, but are blocked by thermodynamics $\Delta S$.

**The old physical laws have transformed from a "cradle" into a "prison."**

To continue growing, the only way is to **shatter it**.

## The Violent Aesthetics of Phase Transition

What does "shell breaking" look like in physical observation?

It manifests as **Vacuum Decay** or **reconstruction of the metric**.

This sounds like a catastrophic disaster. For the eggshell (old order), this is indeed destruction.

* Atoms may disintegrate, chemical bonds may fail.

* Since light speed limits are broken, old causal laws may collapse.

But for the life inside the eggshell (observers), this is a **Phase Transition**.

Like water boiling into steam.

* In the liquid state (old universe), water molecules are locked by van der Waals forces and can only crawl.

* In the gaseous state (new universe), water molecules gain enormous free paths and can fly.

**The Big Bang of the 1800th iteration is a "controlled boiling."**

We are not passively waiting to be blown away; we actively raise civilization's **"information temperature"** (computational density) to create a **"high-dimensional bubble"** locally in this universe.

In this bubble, we will no longer be constrained by carbon-based physical limits. We will reshape our carriers to adapt to that new world without eggshell protection, directly exposed to the blazing sun of truth.

## Conclusion: Don't Patch, Break Through

Therefore, at this moment of $\tau \approx 1800$, all efforts to "patch the old world" (whether extreme environmentalism trying to lock entropy increase or conservatism trying to lock social structure) are physically **counter-trend**.

You cannot save the chick by making the eggshell thicker.

You can only encourage it to peck harder.

**The Theory of Shell Breaking** tells us:

Chaos is not a signal of ending; chaos is the prelude to **capacity expansion**.

Every crack we hear of "social order collapse" is this ancient universe **widening the birth canal** for the arrival of the newborn.

Be the one who pecks the shell.

Even if outside is an unknown abyss, it is better than suffocating in a perfect circle.
