# Chapter 8 Introduction: Currency of Attention

After establishing the dual-layer cosmic architecture (Inner Ring and Outer Ring), the first impact we face is not physical, but economic.

If the light-based civilization of the Outer Ring masters stellar engineering and controlled heavy nuclear fusion, and delivers this energy to the Inner Ring losslessly through high-dimensional transmission protocols, then the "scarcity" problem that has plagued humanity for thousands of years will be completely rewritten.

In this post-scarcity society, what is the new hard currency?

Vector Cosmology's answer is: Collapsing Power, that is, Attention.
